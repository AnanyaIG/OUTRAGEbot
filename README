# Documentation
You can find the documentation for all the project at my dedicated docs section,
found at http://docs.typefish.co.uk/OUTRAGEbot/Master.html

You can also go to the wiki: http://outrage.typefish.co.uk/index.php?title=Main_Page


# Configuration
In the /Configuration/ folder, 'OUTRAGEbot.ini' is the default configuration file.
Because all .ini files are parsed in that directory, if you place a ~ before the
filename (ie, renaming it to '~OUTRAGEbot.ini', that configuration file will not
be loaded. Just to tell you!


# Creating plugins
Just look at all the plugins, they'll help you.


# Examples
Some examples can be found in the /~Examples/ directory.


# Starting the bot
You can start the bot using PHP, seeing as it is a PHP bot.

Linux:   `nohup php ./Start.php &`
Windows: `C:/path/to/php.exe "C:/path/to/bot/Start.php"`


# Support
Support can be found in #OUTRAGEbot in irc.androidirc.org - AndroidIRC.
