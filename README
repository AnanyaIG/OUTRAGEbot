== DOCUMENTATION ==
You can find the documentation for all the project at my dedicated docs section,
found at http://docs.typefish.co.uk/OUTRAGEbot-RC5/Master.html


== CONFIGURATION ==
In the /Configuration/ folder, 'OUTRAGEbot.ini' is the default configuration file.
Because all .ini files are parsed in that directory, if you place a ~ before the
filename (ie, renaming it to '~OUTRAGEbot.ini', that configuration file will not
be loaded. Just to tell you!


== CREATING PLUGINS ==
Just look at all the plugins, they'll help you.


== EXAMPLES ==
Some examples can be found in the /~Examples/ directory.


== STARTING BOT ==
You can start the bot using PHP, seeing as it is a PHP bot.

Linux:   `nohup php ./Start.php &`
Windows: `C:/path/to/php.exe "C:/path/to/bot/Start.php"`


== SUPPORT ==
Support can be found in #OUTRAGEbot in FFSNetwork (irc.ffsnetwork.com).
